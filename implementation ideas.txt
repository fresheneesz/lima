Overwriting of values MUST overwrite the destructor first if necessary (since that's a scenario where the destructor is called).

All the operator overloading stuff is probably implementable via meta, and so are all types probably.
Throw and while can probably be implemented with jump

In javascript, exceptions will probably need to be creatively used to make jump work correctly in longjump situations.

Attributes are easy to implement until you need to consider asynchronous behavior. Without asynchronous behavior, an attribute could be a simple global variable that's set at the start, and its original value replaced at the end. However, in any place where an asynchronous continuation might start, a pointer to what the attribute currently points to must be made and that attribute reset in thread-local global scope at the start of that thread.
